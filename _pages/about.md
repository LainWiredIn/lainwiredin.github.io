Namaste! I am currently working as an NLP Engineer at SentiSum, where I focus on building LLM-powered intelligent systems to improve customer support analytics. I am soon joining Microsoft as a Technical Program Manager (TPM)!

I completed my dual degree (B.Tech + M.S.) in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad, where I also work as a Research Assistant at the Information Retrieval and Extraction Lab (iREL) advised by Dr. Vasudeva Varma. My work spans across multiple domains including evaluation frameworks and robustness, code generation, mental health AI, and healthcare applications. Along the way, I collaborated with the Applied AI Research Centre, IIIT Hyderabad and the FARD Lab at the University of British Columbia (UBC), all of which led to publications in renowned conferences and journals like ACL, ICSE and Nature Scientific Reports.

My research interests lie broadly in deep learning, especially in natural language processing and large language models, while also exploring how AI can contribute meaningfully to healthcare and education. I believe that combining deep technical insight with strong leadership creates the best environment for meaningful solutions. My goal is to keep advancing AI research while driving impactful products that bring these innovations to life in the real world.
