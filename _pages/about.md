Hi, I’m Manav Chaudhary. Currently, I work as an NLP Engineer at SentiSum, where I focus on building intelligent language models to improve customer support analytics through advanced summarization and clustering techniques. Soon, I’ll be joining Microsoft as a Technical Program Manager (TPM), a role that excites me because it perfectly combines my passion for technology, leadership, and research.

I completed my dual degree (B.Tech + M.S.) in Computer Science and Engineering from IIIT Hyderabad, where I also did extensive research at the Information Retrieval and Extraction Lab (iREL) advised by Dr. Vasudeva Varma. My work spans across multiple domains including large language model robustness, code generation, mental health AI, and healthcare applications. Along the way, I collaborated with the Applied AI Research Centre, IIIT Hyderabad and the FARD Lab at the University of British Columbia (UBC), which led to publications in renowned conferences and journals like ACL, ICSE and Nature Scientific Reports.

My interests lie broadly in AI research, especially in natural language processing and large language models, while also exploring how AI can contribute meaningfully to healthcare and education. Beyond research, I’ve gained leadership experience as a Teaching Associate for multiple courses, where I managed projects and guided large teams. This blend of hands-on research and leadership has shaped my approach to innovation and problem-solving.

Looking ahead, I am thrilled about the opportunity at Microsoft to merge research with management. I believe that combining deep technical insight with strong leadership creates the best environment for impactful solutions. My goal is to keep advancing AI research while driving programs that bring these innovations to life in the real world.
