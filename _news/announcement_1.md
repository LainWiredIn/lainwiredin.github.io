Thrilled to share that our paper, “Screening of Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders and Oral Cancer Using Deep Learning Models,” has been accepted in Scientific Reports, a Nature Portfolio journal (2025).

This research was part of my internship at the Applied AI Research Centre (INAI, IIIT Hyderabad), a collaborative initiative by IIIT-H, Intel, the Government of Telangana, and PHFI. We applied AI to improve early detection of oral cancer through deep learning and image analysis.

Grateful to be part of impactful healthcare research using AI.
